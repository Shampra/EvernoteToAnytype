# EvernoteToAnytype - IN DEVELOPMENT!
Enex to JSON converter, for export Evernote note to Anytype



### Environment
```
pip install beautifulsoup4
pip install lxml
pip install scipy
```

For packaged version :
```
pip install PyInstaller 
pyinstaller main.py --additional-hooks-dir=.
```


## Usage
- Launch the gui with "main" file
- drop your enex fils to convert (or a folder with them inside) or select them with the button
- clic to Convert
A _Converted_files_  is created in the folder of your enex files, containing the converted files.

**Warning**
It's under progress. 
Particularly, files (including image) are exported from enex but cannot be imported in Anytype actually (see [here](https://github.com/anyproto/anytype-heart/issues/456)).


**Points to consider :**
Evernote exports are not clean (especially between Legacy and version 10): variations in the method for the same style, unnecessary divs, etc.
